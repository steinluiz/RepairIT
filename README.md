**RepairIT** transforms the boring anvil GUI into a dynamic, immersive, and hands-on repair station. Ditch the menus and let your players physically repair their gear in the world.

This plugin allows players to place a damaged item directly onto an anvil, add the correct repair material, and then use a special **Hammer** to strike the item. With each hit, sparks fly and sounds play, bringing the art of blacksmithing to life on your server!

## ðŸš€ Features

* **Immersive, GUI-less Repairing:** No more menus! All interactions happen physically in the game world.
* **Anvil Visually Place Items:** See your damaged tool or armor piece physically sitting on top of the anvil.
* **Hammer Interactive Hammering:** Players must use a craftable **Hammer** to strike the anvil, making repairs feel earned.
* **Rich Feedback:** Features custom sounds and particle effects (sparks!) for each successful hammer strike.
* **Smart Integration:** Doesn't block the vanilla anvil GUI! If a player's action isn't part of this plugin's system, the normal anvil menu will open.
* **Configurable:** Easily define how much durability each repair material restores (Iron, Gold, Diamond, etc.) in the `config.yml`.
* **ðŸ”„ Update Checker:** Automatically checks for new versions on SpigotMC to let admins know when an update is available.

## ðŸ’¡ How it Works

1.  **Craft the Hammer:** Players must first craft the custom Hammer item.
2.  **Place the Item:** Right-click a damaged, repairable item (like a diamond pickaxe) onto an anvil.
3.  **Add the Material:** Right-click the correct repair material (like a diamond) onto the same anvil.
4.  **Hammer Time!** Left-click the anvil with your Hammer. After a few strikes, the material will be consumed, and your item's durability will be restored!
